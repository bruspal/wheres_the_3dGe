# Where's the 3dGe
## Entry for the GGJ 2018

Lost without your network ?
Try to rebuild it !

There are 4 areas, on each you have to find where is located the network bar before you're out of energy. Radar is turning aroung the area. When it reach th network bar it changing color and emit a 'beep'. This beep will help you to find your way. UNfortunately it is not very loud, so stay concentrate.

When located, stay on the network bar while it's charging. Don't leave it or it will discharge and locked for fiew seconds. Moreover don't collide with the radar or its shoot to avoid energy loose.

Everytime a bar is charged you'll be teleported to the next zone.

On the way you'll find batteries to refill your energy.

Find the 4 before before your energy reach zero.

Using arrow keys or joystick to move.
